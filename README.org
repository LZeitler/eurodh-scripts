* Description

** Data

** Scripts
   ~probability_farm_260419.R~ calculates ancestral frequecies and joint probabilities for figure 2. It requires some time to compute, depending on the machine. To save some time, the output is also saved in the [[./output]] folder. 

   The ~haplotypes_extract_*~ scripts in [[./scripts/hapex/]] are required to calculate haplotype statistics. This also takes some time to compute. For convenience, the output is already saved to [[./output/hapex]].

** Reproduce Figures

* Requirements
- R (tested on 3.6.0)
- vcftools
- plink

** GWAS
- gctb (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/)

** Generate VCF files and impute
- beagle 5.0 (https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/, ~beagle.14May18.ff7.jar~)
